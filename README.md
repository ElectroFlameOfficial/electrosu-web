Powered by [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com), [ElectrOsu!](https://electrosu.tk/), [Sayobot](https://sayobot.cn), and [chimu](https://chimu.moe)(for fallback).

**(under development)**

Note: This is an unofficial implementation of [Osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) modified to work in tandem with the [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag) and [gulag-web](https://github.com/varkaria/gulag-web) server stacks for ElectrOsu!; Scoring and judgement rules can differ from that of official Osu! mainly because it's a private server LOL. Music might not be in sync with the gameplay (working on fixing that). Only standard Osu! is supported as of right now.

## Hosting

it's currently a Make-What-You-Will sort of thing, but I'll *eventually* set up a Self-Hosting guide in the wiki.

## Todos
